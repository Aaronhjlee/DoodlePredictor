  ## Motivation

### Personal

I have always been interested in how machines identify images and the models that underlie the technology as a whole. If a machine is able to identify key elements in an images, maybe that might lend itself to complete more complex tasks: image sorting, labeling, composition construction, self-driving cars, etc. The possibilities are endless. 

### Question

With many complex technologies in the world today, there is always a simple starting point. Before we can start to have machines sort and label things in real life, we have to start with the basics; classifying 2D images of black and white drawings. 
Can we build a model to distinguish hand drawn human facial features? We will begin with the general shape of a face and then move to add more features such as: eyes, ears, mouths, nose, and a beard.

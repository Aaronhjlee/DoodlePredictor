## Motivation

### Personal

I have always been interested in how machines identify images and the models that underlie the technology as a whole. If a machine is able to identify key elements in an images, maybe that might lend itself to complete more complex tasks: image sorting, labeling, composition construction, self-driving cars, etc. The possibilities are endless. 

### Question

With many complex technologies in the world today, there is always a simple starting point. Before we can start to have machines sort and label things in real life, we have to start with the basics; classifying 2D images of black and white drawings. 
Can we build a model to distinguish hand drawn human facial features? We will begin with the general shape of a face and then move to add more features such as: eyes, ears, mouths, nose, and a beard.

## Strategy

#### 1. Load and Clean Data
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
* Transform with Principal Component Analysis
* Find Ideal Varience Percentage / Number of Components
#### 3. Compare Predictive Modeling
* [Logistic Regression Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
* [Decision Tree Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)
* [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
* [Gradient Boosting Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html)
* [Support Vector Machine Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
#### 4. Optimization 
* Use Grid Search to find the best hyper-parameters

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Pipeline (Source)

<!-- ![](images/Pipeline.jpeg) -->

### Data Overview
  1. Dataset: 100000+ label .npy and ndjson files per facial feature from [Quick-Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)
  2. 4 total facial features: face, eyes, nose, and ears
  3. 183 unique countries out of 196 countries (UN considers 241 countries-fun fact!)
  4. Each drawing contained information about the number of strokes, location, timestamp, recognition(binary), and label
  5. Google's [Neural Network](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/python-tensorflow-tutorial/) was able to achieve a recognition rate of over 91% across 345 different categories of doodles
  6. Drawing Examples
Below are drawings that Google's NN recognized and followed by drawings that were not. 

True faces: \

False faces: \

True eyes: \

False eyes: \
![](images/row_false_eyes.png)

True noses: \
![](images/row_true_nose.png)
False noses: \
![](images/row_false_nose.png)

True ears: \
![](images/row_true_ear.png)
False ear: \
![](images/row_false_ear.png)

For the purposes of training and testing our model, we will be using only images that were corrected identified by Google's model to avoid unnecessary errors in our model. 





## Future Analysis

* Include more categories for our model to recognize
* Using a Convolutional Neural Network to predict
* Building a model in the cloud (AWS-EC2) so it can continually add new inputs over time
* Branch out to real images to classify

## Tools Used
